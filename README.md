# kineticEnergy
/*A C program that computes the time required for an object to reach the ground when dropped from a user-specified height, the velocity at which it hits the ground, and the kinetic energy at the moment of impact. Utilizing the <math.h> header, using functions such as sqrt() and double placeholders, three functions are created for each of the three formulas for velocity, kinetic energy, and time an object of mass, m, and height, h, reaches the ground. These three functions are called during the main class and returned in a series of print statements*/
